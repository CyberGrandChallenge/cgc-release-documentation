April, 2015: Scored Event 2 Release
	- Source code to Challenge Binaries used in SE-2
	- Mapping of CBs to event identifiers
	- Clarify backup event submission plan in cgc-qualifier-event-api
          walkthrough
	- Make poll generator create file names consistent with documentation
	- Fix DECREE interaction with Linux capabilities

March, 2015: Pre Scored Event 2 Release
	- Update all CQE event scripts:
	  - Note that dashes in the filenames have been replaced with
	    underscores to allow for easier python imports
	  - Method to verify that a local submission matches the submission
	    received by Amazon S3
	- The cgc-qualifier-event-api walk-through has been updated to reflect
	  the above script changes.
	- The cgc-qualifier-event-api walk-through now documents a backup
	  event submission mechanism in the case of an Amazon S3 outage.
	- cb-server utility now uses higher precision task clock to assist in
	  measuring performance score especially when service polls completed
	  more quickly than the 10ms scheduler clock
	- Update the scoring-cbs walkthrough to reflect the use of the higher
	  precision task clock performance metric
	- Release missing CROMU_00007 CB from Scored Event 1
	- Stricter cb-server socket initialization to remove a
	  non-deterministic corner case in performance calculation on a
	  loaded system
	- Various optimizations to drastically speed up cb-test
	- Added a walk-through for using ptrace to perform instruction tracing
	  of a challenge binary.
	- strace bug fixes:
	  - zero byte allocations
	  - process args on system call entry

February, 2015: Post Scored Event Release
	- Embed CGC Extended Application into every challenge binary
	  specifically to include the event participation agreement.
	- Embed the DECREE debian package listing into every challenge binary
	  to allow for future repeatable testing.
	- Verify PoVs' and polls' XML start tag, DOCTYPE and DTD path
	- Add cqe-verify-solution-package script to validate an event
	  submission
	- Fix typo in cgc-qualifier-event-api walkthrough and bug in the
	  associated cqe-submit-solution.py script
	- Update scoring-cbs walkthrough
	- Include a Newsletter on cyber security Capture-the-Flag tournaments
	  on which CGC is based
	- Service poll generator graphs percentage of polls which visit a node
	- Update allocate() man page
	- Better CB memory usage reporting and scoring walkthrough
	- Proper PCRE grouping in service polls and PoVs

October 31, 2014: Scored Event #1 update Release
	- Updated CQE/Scored Event API documentation and example scripts
	  in response to competitor feedback.
	- Improvements to insure deterministic poller processing.
	- PoV/Poller XML parsing limited to ten seconds.
	- Correct path to the DTD in generated service polls.
	- CBs only dump core on a PoV signal.
	- Easier instrumentation and debugging when running CBs in cb-test.
	- Walkthrough for running Intel PIN on CGC Challenge Binaries.
	- Added a readcgcef-minimal.py which does not depend on insecure libs.
	- cgcef_verify re-implemented in python to reduce insecure dependencies.
	- Allow more arbitrary mappings from the executable headers.
	- Internal robustness improvements.
	- Backport Linux security patches.
